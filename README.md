# Tower Sim

A SimTower-inspired tower-building game, with a twist: it's a maker's building.
Artisans (sewists, potters, woodworkers, jewellers) rent studios, sell in shops,
and live in condos, while visiting buyers stay in the hotel. Layout matters
because noisy studios stress out the neighbors.

Design doc: see the Claude Doc linked from the project this repo belongs to.

## Running it locally

No build step, no install. Just open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the
folder with any static file server, e.g.:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Status

**Milestone 0: repo + "hello tower" page.** The page loads and draws a
placeholder scene (sky, ground, one block for the building). No game logic
yet — that starts at milestone 1 (grid & rendering).

## Stack

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, drawn on an HTML5 `<canvas>`. No framework,
no build tools, no dependencies. This keeps every line of the game readable
and easy to explain, and it means the game can be played by opening a file
or visiting a GitHub Pages link.

## Files

- `index.html` — the page shell and canvas element.
- `render.js` — drawing code. Currently just the placeholder scene; will grow
  into the camera and grid renderer.
